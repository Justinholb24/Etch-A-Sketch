# Etch-A-Sketch
A webpage to play a digital form of the classic 'Etch-A-Sketch' toy! The game uses functions
that allow you to color in black or use an RGB generator that creates a random color
on each tile you hover over. A reset button will clear the space and allow you to start 
fresh. An option to allow you to create a custom grid size will be added in the future.
